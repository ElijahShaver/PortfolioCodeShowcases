# PortfolioCodeShowcases
Showcases of my programming skills, meant to be shown off to people who visit my portfolio. These include C# files that include code that I wrote in Visual Studio for my games that I made in Unity.

Each branch of this repository will be dedicated to different games, and each branch will include a README file explaining what each .cs file does.
